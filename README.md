# XSS-Cross-Site-Scripting-Attack

XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates
an existing web pagewith user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute 
scripts in the victimâ€™s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.
